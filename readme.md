# 51.505 Foundations of Cybersecurity

This is repository for lecture notes and relevant learning materials for [Foundations of Cybersecurity](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/mssd/foundations-of-cybersecurity/) course that I take as part of [Master Security in Security by Design (MSSD)](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/mssd/) in [Singapore University of Techology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). The instructor of this module is [Jianying Zhou](http://jianying.space/).

This lecture not is retroactively written because I took the class in 2019 and I want to make sure that I can retain more knowledge from the class by rewriting the note.

Please note that there will not be any homework answer uploaded here.
